# Here i Create a Responsive Navbar

```
Welcome to My Github Profile.
This code represents a responsive navbar implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
```
The code defines the basic structure of an HTML document, including a navbar component.
CSS styling is applied to the HTML elements to control their appearance and layout.
The navbar has a brand title, toggle button, and a list of navigation links.
Media queries are used to apply specific CSS rules based on the screen width.
When the screen width is less than 500 pixels, the navbar collapses into a mobile-friendly layout.
The toggle button becomes visible, allowing the user to expand or collapse the navigation links.
JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the navbar.
The toggle button's click event triggers a function that adds or removes the "active" class from the navbar links, toggling their display.
This class manipulates the CSS to show or hide the navigation links when the toggle button is clicked.
Overall, the code creates a responsive and interactive navbar that adapts to different screen sizes.
